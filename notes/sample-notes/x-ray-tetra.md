# The X-Ray Tetra: A Transparent Wonder

The X-ray tetra (Pristella maxillaris) is a small, translucent freshwater fish, known for its unique, almost transparent body that reveals its bones and swim bladder. This species is native to the Amazon River's coastal waters in South America and is a popular choice among aquarium enthusiasts. This summary delves into the X-ray tetra's habitat, behavior, diet, and care in captivity.

## Habitat and Distribution

X-ray tetras inhabit the clear and blackwater streams and rivers of the Amazon Basin. They are often found in floodplain areas, where they thrive in the slow-moving, acidic waters with plenty of vegetation.

## Physical Characteristics

X-ray tetras are small, typically reaching only about 1.5 to 2.5 inches in length. Their most striking feature is their translucent body, through which their vertebrae and swim bladder can be seen. They have a silver coloration with a hint of pink and a distinctive dark spot at the base of the tail.

## Social Behavior

These fish are schooling by nature and are known for their peaceful temperament. In the wild, they swim in large groups which provides them with protection against predators. In aquarium settings, it is recommended to keep them in groups of at least six to maintain their social structure.

## Diet

In the wild, X-ray tetras feed on small invertebrates, larvae, and plant matter. In captivity, they are not picky eaters and will accept a wide range of foods including flake, frozen, and live foods. A varied diet is important to ensure they receive all the necessary nutrients.

## Aquarium Care

X-ray tetras are relatively easy to care for, making them suitable for beginner aquarists. They prefer a temperature range of 75°F to 82°F and a pH of 6.0 to 7.5. The aquarium should have plenty of plants and space for swimming. Gentle filtration is recommended to mimic their natural habitat's water flow.

## Breeding

Breeding X-ray tetras in captivity can be achieved with the right conditions. A separate breeding tank with soft, acidic water is ideal. Females lay eggs among plants, and after spawning, parents should be removed to prevent them from eating the eggs. The fry will require infusoria or other small foods until they are large enough to eat standard fry food.

## Conclusion

The X-ray tetra is a fascinating and beautiful fish that can make a great addition to a community aquarium. Their care is straightforward, and their peaceful nature allows them to coexist with many other species. By maintaining proper water conditions and a healthy diet, aquarists can enjoy the beauty of these transparent wonders for many years.
